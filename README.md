Placename Assignment for FullStack Dev 1:

This web app is for a local district to display walking routes. 

There are set routes on the home page open to the public but people can sign up and login. 

When logged in the user can add a set route to their dashboard or add a new location.

Bugs to be fixed/ To Do List:
  1. Home page: Set locations are loading but cannot click through to details.

  2. Set Locations: Details/Front End needs to be developed

  3. User: In location-details.hbs: Currently a user can add and delete details. The fix needs to allow the user to add details once and then after that details can be updated or deleted. 

  4. In Set Locations: Need to add set Details to this. Currently user can add details and delete details- I need to change this so that the user can only upload photos and review and this data automatically uploads to set locations. 

  5. Changing menus- currently when a user goes to the home or about pages, the menu switches back to welcome-menu. I need to make it so that it the user can still  access the home and about pages without switching menus. 

  6. Mongo database. The database is more complex now with associations between users and set locations. I need to create a database that manages the set data, user data and user uploads.
